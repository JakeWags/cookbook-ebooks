## Resources

Many recipes I have found and enjoyed haven't been from cookbooks, rather from websites. Here is a list of those useful websites.

* [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/ "Budget Bytes"): An incredible online resource for great recipes on a budget.
* [/r/EatCheapAndHealthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy"): A reddit forum specifically about eating healthy meals while on a budget. Lots of great advice and tips.
* [Food52](https://food52.com/ "Food52"): Wonderful resource with lots of different tips and recipes for all types of audiences.
* [TasteSpotting](http://www.tastespotting.com/ "Taste Spotting"): A website that uses a bot to scrape the web for hundreds of recipes every week. Always has new content!
